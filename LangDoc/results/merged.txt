Introduction
LangChain  is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:
Data-awar e: connect a language model to other sources of data
Agentic : allow a language model to interact with its environment
The main value props of LangChain are:
1. Components : abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction.
Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. Off-the-shelf chains : a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks
Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to
customize existing chains or build new ones.

To install LangChain run:
Pip Conda
That will install the bare minimum requirements of LangChain. A lot of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various
model providers, datastores, etc. By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NO T installed. However, there are two other ways
to install LangChain that do bring in those dependencies.
To install modules needed for the common LLM providers, run:
To install all modules needed for all integrations, run:

Installation
To install LangChain run:
Pip Conda
For more details, see our Installation guide .
Envir onment setup
Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we'll use
OpenAI's model APIs.
First we'll need to install their Python package:
pip install langchain
pip install openai
----

7/10/23, 9:37 AM Quickstart | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart 2/10Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to
set it as an environment variable by running:
If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when
initiating the OpenAI LLM class:
Building an application
Now we can start building our language model application. LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language
model applications. Modules can be used as stand-alones in simple applications and they can be combined for more complex use
cases.
LLMs
Get pr edictions fr om a language model
The basic building block of LangChain is the LLM, which takes in text and generates more text.export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="...")

7/10/23, 9:37 AM Quickstart | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart 3/10As an example, suppose we're building an application that generates a company name based on a company description. In order to
do this, we need to initialize an OpenAI model wrapper. In this case, since we want the outputs to be MORE random, we'll initialize our
model with a HIGH temperature.
And now we can pass in text and get predictions!
Chat models
Chat models are a variation on language models. While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose
is a bit different: rather than expose a "text in, text out" API, they expose an interface where "chat messages" are the inputs and
outputs.
You can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message. The types of
messages currently supported in LangChain are AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, and ChatMessage -- ChatMessage
takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the time, you'll just be dealing with HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage.from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
llm.predict("What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?")
# >> Feetful of Fun

from langchain.schema import (

https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart 4/10It is useful to understand how chat models are different from a normal LLM, but it can often be handy to just be able to treat them the
same. LangChain makes that easy by also exposing an interface through which you can interact with a chat model as you would a
normal LLM. Y ou can access this through the predict interface.
Prompt t emplat es
Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called
a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand.
In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it'd
be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model
instructions.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart 5/10With PromptT emplates this is easy! In this case our template would be very simple:
Chains
Now that we've got a model and a prompt template, we'll want to combine the two. Chains give us a way to link (or chain) together
multiple primitives, like models, prompts, and other chains.
LLMs Chat models
The simplest and most common type of chain is an LLMChain, which passes an input first to a PromptT emplate and then to an LLM.
We can construct an LLM chain from our existing model and prompt template.
Using this we can replace
withfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?")
prompt.format(product="colorful socks")
What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?
llm.predict("What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?")

https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart 6/10There we go, our first chain! Understanding how this simple chain works will set you up well for working with more complex chains.
Agents
Our first chain ran a pre-determined sequence of steps. T o handle complex workflows, we need to be able to dynamically choose
actions based on inputs.
Agents do just this: they use a language model to determine which actions to take and in what order. Agents are given access to tools,
and they repeatedly choose a tool, run the tool, and observe the output until they come up with a final answer.
To load an agent, you need to choose a(n):
LLM/Chat model: The language model powering the agent.
Tool(s): A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other
chains. For a list of predefined tools and their specifications, see the Tools documentation .
Agent name: A string that references a supported agent class. An agent class is largely parameterized by the prompt the language
model uses to determine which action to take. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers
using the standard supported agents. If you want to implement a custom agent, see here. For a list of supported agents and their
specifications, see here.from langchain.chains import LLMChain

The chains and agents we've looked at so far have been stateless, but for many applications it's necessary to reference past
interactions. This is clearly the case with a chatbot for example, where you want it to understand new messages in the context of past
messages.> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart 9/10The Memory module gives you a way to maintain application state. The base Memory interface is simple: it lets you update state given
the latest run inputs and outputs and it lets you modify (or contextualize) the next input using the stored state.
There are a number of built-in memory systems. The simplest of these is a buffer memory which just prepends the last few
inputs/outputs to the current input - we will use this in the example below.

LangChain: Introduction and Getting Started
Large Language Models (LLMs) entered the world stage with the release of OpenAI’s GPT-3 in 2020 [1]. Since then,
they’ve enjoyed a steady growth in popularity.
That is until late 2022. Interest in LLMs and the broader discipline of generative AI has skyrocketed. The reasons for
this are likely the continuous upward momentum of signi cant advances in LLMs.
We saw the dramatic news about Google’s “sentient” LaMDA chatbot. The  rst high-performance and open-source
LLM called BLOOM was released. OpenAI released their next-generation text embedding model and the next
generation of “GPT-3.5” models.
After all these giant leaps forward in the LLM space, OpenAI released ChatGPT — thrusting LLMs into the spotlight.ANNOUNCEMENT

https://www .pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-intro/ 2/15LangChain appeared around the same time. Its creator, Harrison Chase, made the  rst commit in late October 2022.
Leaving a short couple of months of development before getting caught in the LLM wave.
Despite being early days for the library, it is already packed full of incredible features for building amazing tools around
the core of LLMs. In this article, we’ll introduce the library and start with the most straightforward component o ered
by LangChain — LLMs.
LangChain
At its core, LangChain is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative Question-Answering
(GQA), summarization, and much more.
The core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together di erent components to create more advanced use cases
around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:
Prompt templates: Prompt templates are templates for di erent types of prompts. Like “chatbot” style
templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc
LLMs: Large language models like GPT-3, BLOOM, etc
Agents: Agents use LLMs to decide what actions should be taken. Tools like web search or calculators can be
used, and all are packaged into a logical loop of operations.
Memory: Short-term memory, long-term memory.

updated for each release via our newsletter:
Subscribe to stay updated with LangChain releases!Submit
For now, we’ll start with the basics behind prompt templates and LLMs. We’ll also explore two LLM options available
from the library, using models from Hugging Face Hub or OpenAI.
Our First Prompt Templates
Prompts being input to LLMs are often structured in di erent ways so that we can get di erent results. For Q&A, we
could take a user’s question and reformat it for di erent Q&A styles, like conventional Q&A, a bullet list of answers, or
even a summary of problems relevant to the given question.
Creating Prompts in LangCha in
Let’s put together a simple question-answering prompt template. We  rst need to install the langchain  library.
!pip install langchain
Follow along with the code via Colab!
From here, we import the PromptTemplate  class and initialize a template like so:
----

----
7/10/23, 9:38 AM LangChain: Introduction and Getting Started | Pinecone
https://www .pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-intro/ 4/15from langchain import PromptTemplate
template = """Question: {question} Answer: """
prompt = PromptTemplate(
template=template,
input_variables=['question']
)
# user question
question = "Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?"
Copy
When using these prompt template with the given question  we will get:
Question: Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season? Answer:
For now, that’s all we need. We’ll use the same prompt template across both Hugging Face Hub and OpenAI LLM
generations.
Hugging Face Hub LLM
The Hugging Face Hub endpoint in LangChain connects to the Hugging Face Hub and runs the models via their free
inference endpoints. We need a Hugging Face account and API key to use these endpoints.
Once you have an API key, we add it to the HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN  environment variable. We can do this
with Python like so:
----
Page: 5
----
7/10/23, 9:38 AM LangChain: Introduction and Getting Started | Pinecone
https://www .pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-intro/ 5/15import os
os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN'] = 'HF_API_KEY'
Copy
Next, we must install the huggingface_hub  library via Pip.
!pip install huggingface_hub
Now we can generate text using a Hub model. We’ll use google/ﬂan-t5-x1 .
The default Hugging Face Hub inference APIs do not use specialized hardware and, therefore, can be slow. They are
also not suitable for running larger models like bigscience/bloom-560m  or google/ﬂan-t5-
xxl  (note xxl  vs. xl).
In[3]:
from langchain import HuggingFaceHub, LLMChain
# initialize Hub LLM
hub_llm = HuggingFaceHub(
repo_id='google/ an-t5-xl',

)
# create prompt template > LLM chain

)
# ask the user question about NFL 2010
print(llm_chain.run(question))
CopyOut[3]:
green bay packers
For this question, we get the correct answer of "green bay packers" .
Asking Multiple Questions
If we’d like to ask multiple questions, we can try two approaches:
 . Iterate through all questions using the generate  method, answering them one at a time.
 . Place all questions into a single prompt for the LLM; this will only work for more advanced LLMs.
Starting with option (1), let’s see how to use the generate  method:
In[4]:
qs = [
{'question': "Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?"},
----
Page: 7
----
7/10/23, 9:38 AM LangChain: Introduction and Getting Started | Pinecone
https://www .pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-intro/ 7/15{'question': "If I am 6 ft 4 inches, how tall am I in centimeters?"},
{'question': "Who was the 12th person on the moon?"},
{'question': "How many eyes does a blade of grass have?"}
]
res = llm_chain.generate(qs)
res
CopyOut[4]:
LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='green bay packers', generation_info=None)], [Generation(text='184',
generation_info=None)], [Generation(text='john glenn', generation_info=None)], [Generation(text='one',
generation_info=None)]], llm_output=None)
Here we get bad results except for the  rst question. This is simply a limitation of the LLM being used.
If the model cannot answer individual questions accurately, grouping all queries into a single prompt is unlikely to
work. However, for the sake of experimentation, let’s try it.
In[6]:
multi_template = """Answer the following questions one at a time. Questions: {questions} Answers: """
long_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=multi_template, input_variables=["questions"])
llm_chain = LLMChain(
prompt=long_prompt,
llm= an_t5
)
qs_str = (

"How many eyes does a blade of grass have?"
)
print(llm_chain.run(qs_str))
CopyOut[6]:
If I am 6 ft 4 inches, how tall am I in centimeters
As expected, the results are not helpful. We’ll see later that more powerful LLMs can do this.
OpenAI LLMs
The OpenAI endpoints in LangChain connect to OpenAI directly or via Azure. We need an OpenAI account and API
key to use these endpoints.
Once you have an API key, we add it to the OPENAI_API_TOKEN  environment variable. We can do this with Python
like so:
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_TOKEN'] = 'OPENAI_API_KEY'

Next, we must install the openai  library via Pip.
!pip install openai
Now we can generate text using OpenAI’s GPT-3 generation (or completion) models. We’ll use text-davinci-
003 .
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
davinci = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003')

Alternatively, if you’re using OpenAI via Azure, you can do:

change is that we now pass our OpenAI LLM davinci :

https://www .pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-intro/ 12/15The New Orleans Saints won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season.
6 ft 4 inches is 193 centimeters.
The 12th person on the moon was Harrison Schmitt.
A blade of grass does not have eyes.
As we keep rerunning the query, the model will occasionally make errors, but at other times manage to get all answers
correct.
That’s it for our introduction to LangChain — a library that allows us to build more advanced apps around LLMs like
OpenAI’s GPT-3 models or the open-source alternatives available via Hugging Face.
As mentioned, LangChain can do much more than we’ve demonstrated here. We’ll be covering these other features in
upcoming articles.

Prompt t emplat es
Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt. T ypically this is not simply a hardcoded string but
rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user input. LangChain provides several classes and functions to make
constructing and working with prompts easy.
What is a pr ompt t emplat e?
A prompt template refers to a reproducible way to generate a prompt. It contains a text string ("the template"), that can take in a set
of parameters from the end user and generates a prompt.
A prompt template can contain:
instructions to the language model,
a set of few shot examples to help the language model generate a better response,
a question to the language model.
Here's the simplest example:
from langchain import PromptTemplate
template = """/
You are a naming consultant for new companies.

and can be formatted to generate a prompt.What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?

    You are a naming consultant for new companies.
    What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?
from langchain import PromptTemplate
# An example prompt with no input variables
no_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template="Tell me a joke.")
no_input_prompt.format()
# -> "Tell me a joke."
# An example prompt with one input variable
one_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["adjective"], template="Tell me a {adjective} joke.")
one_input_prompt.format(adjective="funny")
# -> "Tell me a funny joke."
# An example prompt with multiple input variables

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/ 3/5If you do not wish to specify input_variables manually, you can also create a PromptTemplate using from_template class method.
langchain will automatically infer the input_variables based on the template passed.
You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see Custom Prompt
Templates .
Chat pr ompt t emplat e
Chat Models  take a list of chat messages as input - this list commonly referred to as a prompt. These chat messages differ from raw
string (which you would pass into a LLM model) in that every message is associated with a role.
For example, in OpenAI Chat Completion API , a chat message can be associated with the AI, human or system role. The model is
supposed to follow instruction from system chat message more closely.    input_variables=["adjective", "content"], 
    template="Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."
)
multiple_input_prompt.format(adjective="funny", content="chickens")
# -> "Tell me a funny joke about chickens."
template = "Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
prompt_template.input_variables
# -> ['adjective', 'content']
prompt_template.format(adjective="funny", content="chickens")
# -> Tell me a funny joke about chickens.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/ 4/5LangChain provides several prompt templates to make constructing and working with prompts easily. Y ou are encouraged to use
these chat related prompt templates instead of PromptTemplate when querying chat models to fully exploit the potential of
underlying chat model.
To create a message template associated with a role, you use MessagePromptTemplate.
For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would
look like:
If you wanted to construct the MessagePromptTemplate more directly, you could create a PromptT emplate outside and then pass it in,
eg:from langchain.prompts import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    PromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    AIMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.schema import (
    AIMessage,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage
)
template="You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template="{text}"
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/ 5/5After that, you can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate's
format_prompt -- this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want
to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.prompt=PromptTemplate(
    template="You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.",
    input_variables=["input_language", "output_language"],
)
system_message_prompt_2 = SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=prompt)
assert system_message_prompt == system_message_prompt_2
chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])
# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language="English", output_language="French", text="I love

Connecting t o a Featur e Store
Feature stores are a concept from traditional machine learning that make sure data fed into models is up-to-date and relevant. For
more on this, see here.
This concept is extremely relevant when considering putting LLM applications in production. In order to personalize LLM applications,
you may want to combine LLMs with up-to-date information about particular users. Feature stores can be a great way to keep that
data fresh, and LangChain provides an easy way to combine that data with LLMs.
In this notebook we will show how to connect prompt templates to feature stores. The basic idea is to call a feature store from inside a
prompt template to retrieve values that are then formatted into the prompt.
Feast
To start, we will use the popular open source feature store framework Feast .
This assumes you have already run the steps in the README around getting started. W e will build of off that example in getting
started, and create and LLMChain to write a note to a specific driver regarding their up-to-date statistics.
Load Feast S tore
Again, this should be set up according to the instructions in the Feast README

stats into a prompt.
Note that the input to this prompt template is just driver_id, since that is the only user defined piece (all other variables are looked
up inside the prompt template).from feast import FeatureStore

Custom pr ompt t emplat e
Let's suppose we want the LLM to generate English language explanations of a function given its name. T o achieve this task, we will
create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source
code of the function.
Why ar e cust om pr ompt t emplat es needed?
LangChain provides a set of default prompt templates that can be used to generate prompts for a variety of tasks. However, there may
be cases where the default prompt templates do not meet your needs. For example, you may want to create a prompt template with
specific dynamic instructions for your language model. In such cases, you can create a custom prompt template.
Take a look at the current set of default prompt templates here.
Creating a Cust om Pr ompt T emplat e
There are essentially two distinct prompt templates available - string prompt templates and chat prompt templates. S tring prompt
templates provides a simple prompt in string format, while chat prompt templates produces a more structured prompt to be used
with a chat API.
In this guide, we will create a custom prompt using a string prompt template.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template 2/4To create a custom string prompt template, there are two requirements:
1. It has an input_variables attribute that exposes what input variables the prompt template expects.
2. It exposes a format method that takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the expected input_variables and returns the
formatted prompt.
We will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input and formats the prompt to provide the source code
of the function. T o achieve this, let's first create a function that will return the source code of a function given its name.
Next, we'll create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the
source code of the function.import inspect

Few-shot pr ompt t emplat es
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a prompt template that uses few shot examples. A few shot prompt template can be
constructed from either a set of examples, or from an Example Selector object.
Use Case
In this tutorial, we'll configure few shot examples for self-ask with search.
Using an example set
Create the example set
To get started, create a list of few shot examples. Each example should be a dictionary with the keys being the input variables and the
values being the values for those input variables.

Few shot examples for chat models
This notebook covers how to use few shot examples in chat models.
There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few shot prompting. As a result, we are not solidifying any
abstractions around this yet but rather using existing abstractions.
Alternating Human/AI messages
The first way of doing few shot prompting relies on using alternating human/ai messages. See an example of this below.
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    AIMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,

OpenAI provides an optional name parameter that they also recommend using in conjunction with system messages to do few shot
prompting. Here is an example of how to do that below.template = "You are a helpful assistant that translates english to pirate."
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
example_human = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template("Hi")
example_ai = AIMessagePromptTemplate.from_template("Argh me mateys")

LangChain provides different types of MessagePromptTemplate. The most commonly used are AIMessagePromptTemplate,
SystemMessagePromptTemplate and HumanMessagePromptTemplate, which create an AI message, system message and human
message respectively.
However, in cases where the chat model supports taking chat message with arbitrary role, you can use ChatMessagePromptTemplate,
which allows user to specify the role name.
LangChain also provides MessagesPlaceholder, which gives you full control of what messages to be rendered during formatting. This
can be useful when you are uncertain of what role you should be using for your message prompt templates or when you wish to insert
a list of messages during formatting.
from langchain.prompts import ChatMessagePromptTemplate
prompt = "May the {subject} be with you"
chat_message_prompt = ChatMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(role="Jedi", template=prompt)

7/10/23, 9:42 AM Partial prompt templates | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/partial 1/3Modules Model I/ O Prompts Prompt templates Partial prompt templates
Partial pr ompt t emplat es
Like other methods, it can make sense to "partial" a prompt template - eg pass in a subset of the required values, as to create a new
prompt template which expects only the remaining subset of values.
LangChain supports this in two ways:
1. Partial formatting with string values.
2. Partial formatting with functions that return string values.
These two different ways support different use cases. In the examples below, we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as
how to do it in LangChain.
Partial With S trings
One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example,
suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, foo and baz. If you get the foo value early on in the chain, but the
baz value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template.
Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the foo value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that.
Below is an example of doing this:
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
----
Page: 2
----
7/10/23, 9:42 AM Partial prompt templates | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/partial 2/3You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables.
Partial With Functions
The other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want
to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have
the current date. Y ou can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case,
it's very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date.prompt = PromptTemplate(template="{foo}{bar}", input_variables=["foo", "bar"])
partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo="foo");
print(partial_prompt.format(bar="baz"))
    foobaz
prompt = PromptTemplate(template="{foo}{bar}", input_variables=["bar"], partial_variables={"foo": "foo"})
print(prompt.format(bar="baz"))
    foobaz
from datetime import datetime
def _get_datetime():

7/10/23, 9:42 AM Partial prompt templates | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/partial 3/3You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables, which often makes more sense in this workflow.    now = datetime.now()
    return now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}", 
    input_variables=["adjective", "date"]
);
partial_prompt = prompt.partial(date=_get_datetime)
print(partial_prompt.format(adjective="funny"))
    Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}", 
    input_variables=["adjective"],
    partial_variables={"date": _get_datetime}

This can be done with a PipelinePrompt. A PipelinePrompt consists of two main parts:

Pipeline prompts: This is a list of tuples, consisting of a string name and a prompt template. Each prompt template will be
formatted and then passed to future prompt templates as a variable with the same name.

Serialization
It is often preferrable to store prompts not as python code but as files. This can make it easy to share, store, and version prompts. This
notebook covers how to do that in LangChain, walking through all the different types of prompts and the different serialization
options.
At a high level, the following design principles are applied to serialization:
1. Both JSON and Y AML are supported. W e want to support serialization methods that are human readable on disk, and Y AML and
JSON are two of the most popular methods for that. Note that this rule applies to prompts. For other assets, like Examples,
different serialization methods may be supported.
2. We support specifying everything in one file, or storing different components (templates, examples, etc) in different files and
referencing them. For some cases, storing everything in file makes the most sense, but for others it is preferrable to split up some
of the assets (long templates, large examples, reusable components). LangChain supports both.
There is also a single entry point to load prompts from disk, making it easy to load any type of prompt.

Example select ors
If you have a large number of examples, you may need to select which ones to include in the prompt. The Example Selector is the class
responsible for doing so.
The base interface is defined as below:
The only method it needs to expose is a select_examples method. This takes in the input variables and then returns a list of
examples. It is up to each specific implementation as to how those examples are selected. Let's take a look at some below.
class BaseExampleSelector(ABC):
    """Interface for selecting examples to include in prompts."""
    @abstractmethod
    def select_examples(self, input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]:

Custom example select or
In this tutorial, we'll create a custom example selector that selects every alternate example from a given list of examples.
An ExampleSelector must implement two methods:
1. An add_example method which takes in an example and adds it into the ExampleSelector
2. A select_examples method which takes in input variables (which are meant to be user input) and returns a list of examples to
use in the few shot prompt.
Let's implement a custom ExampleSelector that just selects two examples at random.

The NGramOverlapExampleSelector selects and orders examples based on which examples are most similar to the input, according
to an ngram overlap score. The ngram overlap score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
The selector allows for a threshold score to be set. Examples with an ngram overlap score less than or equal to the threshold are
excluded. The threshold is set to -1.0, by default, so will not exclude any examples, only reorder them. Setting the threshold to 0.0 will
exclude examples that have no ngram overlaps with the input.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/ 1/1Modules Model I/ O Language models
Language models
LangChain provides interfaces and integrations for two types of models:
LLMs : Models that take a text string as input and return a text string
Chat models : Models that are backed by a language model but take a list of Chat Messages as input and return a Chat Message
LLMs vs Chat Models
LLMs and Chat Models are subtly but importantly different. LLMs in LangChain refer to pure text completion models. The APIs they
wrap take a string prompt as input and output a string completion. OpenAI's GPT-3 is implemented as an LLM. Chat models are often
backed by LLMs but tuned specifically for having conversations. And, crucially, their provider APIs expose a different interface than
pure text completion models. Instead of a single string, they take a list of chat messages as input. Usually these messages are labeled
with the speaker (usually one of "S ystem", "AI", and "Human"). And they return a ("AI") chat message as output. GPT-4 and Anthropic's
Claude are both implemented as Chat Models.
To make it possible to swap LLMs and Chat Models, both implement the Base Language Model interface. This exposes common
methods "predict", which takes a string and returns a string, and "predict messages", which takes messages and returns a message. If
you are using a specific model it's recommended you use the methods specific to that model class (i.e., "predict" for LLMs and "predict
messages" for Chat Models), but if you're creating an application that should work with different types of models the shared interface
can be helpful.

LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain. LangChain does not serve it's own LLMs, but rather provides a
standard interface for interacting with many different LLMs.
For more detailed documentation check out our:
How-t o guides : Walkthroughs of core functionality, like streaming, async, etc.
Integrations : How to use different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
Get star ted
There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging F ace, etc) - the LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all
of them.
In this walkthrough we'll work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types.
Setup
To start we'll need to install the OpenAI Python package:
pip install openai

set it as an environment variable by running:
If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when
initiating the OpenAI LLM class:
otherwise you can initialize without any params:
__call__: string in -> str ing out
The simplest way to use an LLM is a callable: pass in a string, get a string completion.export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

Async API
LangChain provides async support for LLMs by leveraging the asyncio  library.
Async support is particularly useful for calling multiple LLMs concurrently, as these calls are network-bound. Currently, OpenAI,
PromptLayerOpenAI, ChatOpenAI and Anthropic are supported, but async support for other LLMs is on the roadmap.
You can use the agenerate method to call an OpenAI LLM asynchronously.

Custom LLM
This notebook goes over how to create a custom LLM wrapper, in case you want to use your own LLM or a different wrapper than one
that is supported in LangChain.
There is only one required thing that a custom LLM needs to implement:
1. A _call method that takes in a string, some optional stop words, and returns a string
There is a second optional thing it can implement:
1. An _identifying_params property that is used to help with printing of this class. Should return a dictionary.
Let's implement a very simple custom LLM that just returns the first N characters of the input.
from typing import Any, List, Mapping, Optional
from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManagerForLLMRun
from langchain.llms.base import LLM
class CustomLLM(LLM):

Fake LLM
We expose a fake LLM class that can be used for testing. This allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and simulate what would
happen if the LLM responded in a certain way.
In this notebook we go over how to use this.
We start this with using the F akeLLM in an agent.

Similar to the fake LLM, LangChain provides a pseudo LLM class that can be used for testing, debugging, or educational purposes. This
allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and simulate how a human would respond if they received the prompts.

Caching
LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons:
It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you're often requesting the same
completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.

chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards.

S tr eaming
Some LLMs provide a streaming response. This means that instead of waiting for the entire response to be returned, you can start
processing it as soon as it's available. This is useful if you want to display the response to the user as it's being generated, or if you
want to process the response as it's being generated.
Currently, we support streaming for the OpenAI, ChatOpenAI, and ChatAnthropic implementations. T o utilize streaming, use a
CallbackHandler that implements on_llm_new_token. In this example, we are using StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler.
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
llm = OpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)

Tracking t oken usage
This notebook goes over how to track your token usage for specific calls. It is currently only implemented for the OpenAI API.
Let's first look at an extremely simple example of tracking token usage for a single LLM call.
Anything inside the context manager will get tracked. Here's an example of using it to track multiple calls in sequence.
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback
llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-002", n=2, best_of=2)
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    result = llm("Tell me a joke")
    print(cb)

Amazon API Gat eway
Amazon API Gateway  is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure
APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend
services. Using API Gateway, you can create REST ful APIs and W ebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication
applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including
traffic management, C ORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API
Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. Y ou pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with
the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with Azure OpenAI .
The Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API. The openai Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure
OpenAI. Y ou can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.
API configuration
You can configure the openai package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables. The following is for bash:
Alternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:
# Set this to `azure`
export OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure
# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-03-15-preview` for the released version.
export OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-03-15-preview
# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI

This example notebook shows how to wrap Databricks endpoints as LLMs in LangChain. It supports two endpoint types:
Serving endpoint, recommended for production and development,
Cluster driver proxy app, recommended for iteractive development.
Wrapping a ser ving endpoint
Prerequisites:
An LLM was registered and deployed to a Databricks serving endpoint .
You have "Can Query" permission  to the endpoint.
The expected MLflow model signature is:

Prerequisites:
An LLM loaded on a Databricks interactive cluster in "single user" or "no isolation shared" mode.
A local HT TP server running on the driver node to serve the model at "/" using HT TP POST with JSON input/output.
It uses a port number between [3000, 8000] and listens to the driver IP address or simply 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost only.
You have "Can Attach T o" permission to the cluster.
The expected server schema (using JSON schema) is:
inputs:
outputs: {"type": "string"}llm("How are you?")
    'I’m Excellent. You?'
{"type": "object",
 "properties": {
    "prompt": {"type": "string"},
     "stop": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}},
  "required": ["prompt"]}

OpenLLM
🦾 OpenLLM  is an open platform for operating large language models (LLMs) in production. It enables developers to easily run
inference with any open-source LLMs, deploy to the cloud or on-premises, and build powerful AI apps.
Installation
Install openllm through PyPI
Launch OpenLLM ser ver locally
To start an LLM server, use openllm start command. For example, to start a dolly-v2 server, run the following command from a
terminal:
Wrapper
pip install openllm
openllm start dolly-v2

You may also choose to initialize an LLM managed by OpenLLM locally from current process. This is useful for development purpose
and allows developers to quickly try out different types of LLMs.
When moving LLM applications to production, we recommend deploying the OpenLLM server separately and access via the
server_url option demonstrated above.
To load an LLM locally via the LangChain wrapper:
Integrat e with a LLMChainfrom langchain.llms import OpenLLM
server_url = "http://localhost:3000" # Replace with remote host if you are running on a remote server 
llm = OpenLLM(server_url=server_url)

Chat models
Chat models are a variation on language models. While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose
is a bit different. Rather than expose a "text in, text out" API, they expose an interface where "chat messages" are the inputs and
outputs.
Chat model APIs are fairly new, so we are still figuring out the correct abstractions.
The following sections of documentation are provided:
How-t o guides : Walkthroughs of core functionality, like streaming, creating chat prompts, etc.
Integrations : How to use different chat model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc).

Setup
To start we'll need to install the OpenAI Python package:
pip install openai

7/10/23, 9:55 AM Chat models | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/chat/ 2/5Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to
set it as an environment variable by running:
If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when
initiating the OpenAI LLM class:
otherwise you can initialize without any params:
Messages
The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. The types of messages currently supported in LangChain are
AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, and ChatMessage -- ChatMessage takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the
time, you'll just be dealing with HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/chat/ 3/5You can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message.
OpenAI's chat model supports multiple messages as input. See here for more information. Here is an example of sending a system
and user message to the chat model:

Along with HumanInputLLM, LangChain also provides a pseudo Chat Model class that can be used for testing, debugging, or
educational purposes. This allows you to mock out calls to the Chat Model and simulate how a human would respond if they received
the messages.
In this notebook, we go over how to use this.
We start this with using the HumanInputChatModel in an agent.

done so already.

Pr ompts
Prompts for Chat models are built around messages, instead of just plain text.
You can make use of templating by using a MessagePromptTemplate. You can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more
MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate's format_prompt -- this returns a PromptValue, which you can
convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.
For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would
look like:
from langchain import PromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    AIMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
template="You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template="{text}"
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

Note: This is seperate from the Google P aLM integration. Google has chosen to offer an enterprise version of P aLM through GCP, and
this supports the models made available through there.
PaLM API on V ertex AI is a Preview offering, subject to the Pre-GA Offerings T erms of the GCP Service Specific T erms .
Pre-GA products and features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with
other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions . Further, by using P aLM API on V ertex AI, you agree to
the Generative AI Preview terms and conditions  (Preview T erms).
For P aLM API on V ertex AI, you can process personal data as outlined in the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, subject to applicable
restrictions and obligations in the Agreement (as defined in the Preview T erms).
To use V ertex AI P aLM you must have the google-cloud-aiplatform Python package installed and either:
Have credentials configured for your environment (gcloud, workload identity, etc...)
Store the path to a service account JSON file as the GOOGLE_APPLICA TION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
This codebase uses the google.auth library which first looks for the application credentials variable mentioned above, and then looks
for system-level auth.

convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.
For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would
look like:    AIMessage(content="J'aime programmer.", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)
template = (
    "You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."
)
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template = "{text}"
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)
chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt]
)
# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat(
    chat_prompt.format_prompt(
        input_language="English", output_language="French", text="I love programming."
    ).to_messages()

Output p arsers
Language models output text. But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where
output parsers come in.
Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must
implement:
"Get format instructions": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should
be formatted.
"Parse": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.
And then one optional one:
"Parse with prompt": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt
(assumed to the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the
event the OutputP arser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.

This output parser wraps another output parser, and in the event that the first one fails it calls out to another LLM to fix any errors.
But we can do other things besides throw errors. Specifically, we can pass the misformatted output, along with the formatted
instructions, to the model and ask it to fix it.

Keep in mind that large language models are leaky abstractions! Y ou'll have to use an LLM with sufficient capacity to generate well-

Use Pydantic to declare your data model. Pydantic's BaseModel like a Python dataclass, but with actual type checking + coercion.

Structur ed output p arser
This output parser can be used when you want to return multiple fields. While the Pydantic/JSON parser is more powerful, we initially
experimented with data structures having text fields only.
Here we define the response schema we want to receive.
We now get a string that contains instructions for how the response should be formatted, and we then insert that into our prompt.

website.")

Data connection
Many LLM applications require user-specific data that is not part of the model's training set. LangChain gives you the building blocks
to load, transform, store and query your data via:
Document loaders : Load documents from many different sources
Document transformers : Split documents, drop redundant documents, and more
Text embedding models : Take unstructured text and turn it into a list of floating point numbers
Vector stores : Store and search over embedded data
Retrievers : Query your data

Document lo ader s
Use document loaders to load data from a source as Document's. A Document is a piece of text and associated metadata. For example,
there are document loaders for loading a simple .txt file, for loading the text contents of any web page, or even for loading a
transcript of a Y ouTube video.
Document loaders expose a "load" method for loading data as documents from a configured source. They optionally implement a
"lazy load" as well for lazily loading data into memory.

File Dir ectory
This covers how to load all documents in a directory.
Under the hood, by default this uses the UnstructuredLoader
We can use the glob parameter to control which files to load. Note that here it doesn't load the .rst file or the .html files.
Show a pr ogress b ar

show_progress parameter to True.
Use multithr eading
By default the loading happens in one thread. In order to utilize several threads set the use_multithreading flag to true.
Change lo ader class
By default this uses the UnstructuredLoader class. However, you can change up the type of loader pretty easily.loader = DirectoryLoader('../', glob="**/*.md", show_progress=True)
docs = loader.load()
    Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /Users/jon/.pyenv/versions/3.9.16/envs/microbiome-

In this example we will see some strategies that can be useful when loading a big list of arbitrary files from a directory using the
TextLoader class.
First to illustrate the problem, let's try to load multiple text with arbitrary encodings.

JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)  is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to
store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).
JSON Lines  is a file format where each line is a valid JSON value.
The JSONLoader uses a specified jq schema  to parse the JSON files. It uses the jq python package. Check this manual  for a
detailed documentation of the jq syntax.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/how_to/markdown 7/12Extracting metadata
Generally, we want to include metadata available in the JSON file into the documents that we create from the content.
The following demonstrates how metadata can be extracted using the JSONLoader.
There are some key changes to be noted. In the previous example where we didn't collect the metadata, we managed to directly
specify in the schema where the value for the page_content can be extracted from.
In the current example, we have to tell the loader to iterate over the records in the messages field. The jq_schema then has to be:
This allows us to pass the records (dict) into the metadata_func that has to be implemented. The metadata_func is responsible for
identifying which pieces of information in the record should be included in the metadata stored in the final Document object.
Additionally, we now have to explicitly specify in the loader, via the content_key argument, the key from the record where the value
for the page_content needs to be extracted from.'langchain/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/example_data/facebook_chat_messages.jsonl',

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/how_to/markdown 10/12As shown above, the metadata_func accepts the default metadata generated by the JSONLoader. This allows full control to the user
with respect to how the metadata is formatted.
For example, the default metadata contains the source and the seq_num keys. However, it is possible that the JSON data contain
these keys as well. The user can then exploit the metadata_func to rename the default keys and use the ones from the JSON data.
The example below shows how we can modify the source to only contain information of the file source relative to the langchain
directory.

(LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they 
previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly 
powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or 
knowledge.\n\nThis library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples 
of these applications include:\n\nâ\x9d“ Question Answering over specific documents\n\nDocumentation\n\nEnd-

functions)\n\nReference (full API docs)\n\nResources (high-level explanation of core 
concepts)\n\nð\x9f\x9a\x80 What can this help with?\n\nThere are six main areas that LangChain is designed to 
help with.\nThese are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\nð\x9f“\x83 LLMs and Prompts:\n\nThis includes 
prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working 
with LLMs.\n\nð\x9f”\x97 Chains:\n\nChains go beyond a single LLM call and involve sequences of calls 
(whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of 
integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n\nð\x9f“\x9a Data Augmented 
Generation:\n\nData Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an 
external data source to fetch data for use in the generation step. Examples include summarization of long 
pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\n\nð\x9f¤\x96 Agents:\n\nAgents involve an 
LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating 
that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, 
and examples of end-to-end agents.\n\nð\x9f§\xa0 Memory:\n\nMemory refers to persisting state between calls 
of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, 
and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n\nð\x9f§\x90 Evaluation:\n\n[BETA] Generative models are 
notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language 
models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\nFor 
more information on these concepts, please see our full documentation.\n\nð\x9f’\x81 Contributing\n\nAs an 
open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether it be in 
the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.\n\nFor detailed information on

([11]). When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth 
hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of 
some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in 
[7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea 
in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties

theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard 
Lefschetz.\n\nCayley trick and Cayley proposition\n\nThe Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth 
intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let 
π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕  ⋯  ⊕  L s . It 
is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the 
degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of 
P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\n\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth 
intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y 
cut oﬀ by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in 
[7].\n\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .\n\nThe 
following is a key remark.\n\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶  X → Y ⊂  P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every 
point z ∶  = ( x, y ) ∈  Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂  X ⊂  P d Σ there 
exists W ʹ ⊂  Y ⊂  P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ʹ ) = W , i.e., W ʹ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣  x ∈  W } .\n\nFor X ⊂ 
P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗  ∶  H d − s (

structure.\n\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\n\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] 
Let X = X 1 ∩ ⋅  ⋅  ⋅ ∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials 
f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2\n\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true 
with rational coeﬃcients since H ● ( X, C ) = H ● ( X, Q ) ⊗  Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] 
for more details.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯  + y k f k = 0 } ⊂  P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-
smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ∩ X f k ⊂  P k + 2 Σ 
. Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 
we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃  H 1 , 
1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\n\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero 
algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are 
n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the 
class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦  λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained 
in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α 
∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈  Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂  P k + 2 Σ can be 
interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = 
{ F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯  + y k f k = 0 } and\n\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\n\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a 
basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or 
equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By 
contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂  P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈  H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ 
,X , Q ) with i ∗  ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic 
subvariety V ⊂  P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X 
,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π 
∶ ( x, y ) ↦  x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ 
which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\n\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key

analysis\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\ntation tasks on 
historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for 
identifying document elements [38]\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] 
have also\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\nindividually and 
there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating 
open-source tools for document\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 
5M\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\nor provide limited 
functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a 
complete toolkit for DIA. However,\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is 
designed for\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\nThe 
DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\ndocuments via analyzing the stored 
PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models 
trained on\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\nAnalysis and 
Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA 
methods (or DL models), yet they\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 
and\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\nDIA tasks like layout 
analysis.\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\nreproducibility and 
reusability in the ﬁeld of DL. Libraries like Dectectron2 [35],\n6 The number shown is obtained by specifying

Google Dr ive
Google Drive  is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google.
This notebook covers how to load documents from Google Drive. Currently, only Google Docs are supported.
Prerequisit es
1. Create a Google Cloud project or use an existing project
2. Enable the Google Drive API
3. Authorize credentials for desktop app
4. pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
🧑 Instr uctions for ingesting y our Google Docs data
By default, the GoogleDriveLoader expects the credentials.json file to be ~/.credentials/credentials.json, but this is
configurable using the credentials_path keyword argument. Same thing with token.json - token_path. Note that token.json
will be created automatically the first time you use the loader.
GoogleDriveLoader can load from a list of Google Docs document ids or a folder id. Y ou can obtain your folder and document id
from the URL:

When processing files other than Google Docs and Google Sheets, it can be helpful to pass an optional file loader to
GoogleDriveLoader. If you pass in a file loader, that file loader will be used on documents that do not have a Google Docs or Google
Sheets MIME type. Here is an example of how to load an Excel document from Google Drive using a file loader.

really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named 
Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to 
making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the 
Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of 
Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.
<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. 
Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\'s not shot like some cheaply made 
porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish 
cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br 
/><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic 
purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I 
AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of 
Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\'t have much of a plot.', metadata={'label': 0}),
     Document(page_content='"I Am Curious: Yellow" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn\'t 
matter what one\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for 
the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\'t true. I\'ve seen R-rated films with 
male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas 
and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs 
swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, 
in which we\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on 
Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) "double-standard" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should 
take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals 
on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\'t 
see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-
standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the 
insides of women\'s bodies.', metadata={'label': 0}),

she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a 
much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to 
play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball,

Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-

Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his

manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) 
Everybody looks great, but so what? It\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\'s what you\'re 
looking for you\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that 
Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly 
unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. 
Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\'s title is derived) had in mind; 
his stage musicals of the 20\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. "They All 
Laughed" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good 
sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this 
movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then 
distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the 
more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ 
real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\'s scenes. But "Laughed" is a faint echo of "The Last Picture 
Show", "Paper Moon" or "What\'s Up, Doc"- following "Daisy Miller" and "At Long Last Love", it was a 
thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the 
movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time, I\'ll go to the park on 
a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love, I\'ll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...',

doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was.

right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like 
Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She 
doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every 
character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from

hit television series called "Moonlighting" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a 
great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with

names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the 
price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an 
excellent reference. I looked in "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and \x96 wow \x96 four 
stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished 
watching "They All Laughed" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, 
and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private 
eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The 
coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive 
man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite 
ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and 
playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and 
whose life was showed in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story"; the amazing 
beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two 
years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto 
Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60\'s and is called by his fans as 
"The King". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy 
Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many Laughs and Lots of 
Happiness")', metadata={'label': 0})]

Microsoft OneDrive  (formerly SkyDrive) is a file hosting service operated by Microsoft.
This notebook covers how to load documents from OneDrive. Currently, only docx, doc, and pdf files are supported.
Prerequisit es
1. Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform  instructions.
2. When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration's Overview pane. Y ou see the Application (client) ID. Also
called the client ID, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform.
3. During the steps you will be following at item 1 , you can set the redirect URI as http://localhost:8000/callback
4. During the steps you will be following at item 1 , generate a new password ( client_secret) under Application Secrets section.
5. Follow the instructions at this document  to add the following SCOPES (offline_access and Files.Read.All) to your
application.
6. Visit the Graph Explorer Playground  to obtain your OneDrive ID. The first step is to ensure you are logged in with the account
associated your OneDrive account. Then you need to make a request to https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive and the
response will return a payload with a field id that holds the ID of your OneDrive account.
7. You need to install the o365 package using the command pip install o365.
8. At the end of the steps you must have the following values:
CLIENT_ID

DRIVE_ID
🧑 Instr uctions for ingesting y our documents fr om OneDr ive
🔑 Authentication
By default, the OneDriveLoader expects that the values of CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET must be stored as environment variables
named O365_CLIENT_ID and O365_CLIENT_SECRET respectively. Y ou could pass those environment variables through a .env file at
the root of your application or using the following command in your script.
This loader uses an authentication called on behalf o f a us er. It is a 2 step authentication with user consent. When you instantiate the
loader, it will call will print a url that the user must visit to give consent to the app on the required permissions. The user must then
visit this url and give consent to the application. Then the user must copy the resulting page url and paste it back on the console. The
method will then return T rue if the login attempt was succesful.
Once the authentication has been done, the loader will store a token ( o365_token.txt) at ~/.credentials/ folder. This token could
be used later to authenticate without the copy/paste steps explained earlier. T o use this token for authentication, you need to changeos.environ['O365_CLIENT_ID'] = "YOUR CLIENT ID"
os.environ['O365_CLIENT_SECRET'] = "YOUR CLIENT SECRET"

📑 Loading documents fr om a OneDriv e Dir ectory
OneDriveLoader can load documents from a specific folder within your OneDrive. For instance, you want to load all documents that
are stored at Documents/clients folder within your OneDrive.
📑 Loading documents fr om a list o f Documents IDs
Another possibility is to provide a list of object_id for each document you want to load. For that, you will need to query the
Microsoft Graph API  to find all the documents ID that you are interested in. This link provides a list of endpoints that will be helpful to
retrieve the documents ID.
For instance, to retrieve information about all objects that are stored at the root of the Documents folder, you need make a request to:
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{YOUR DRIVE ID}/root/children. Once you have the list of IDs that you are
interested in, then you can instantiate the loader with the following parameters.from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader

Document transfor mers
Once you've loaded documents, you'll often want to transform them to better suit your application. The simplest example is you may
want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain has a number of built-in
document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.
Text splitt ers
When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a lot
of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What "semantically related"
means could depend on the type of text. This notebook showcases several ways to do that.
At a high level, text splitters work as following:
1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).
2. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).
3. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to
keep context between chunks).
That means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text splitter:
1. How the text is split
2. How the chunk size is measured

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/ 2/3Get star ted with t ext splitt ers
The default recommended text splitter is the R ecursiveCharacterT extSplitter. This text splitter takes a list of characters. It tries to create
chunks based on splitting on the first character, but if any chunks are too large it then moves onto the next character, and so forth. By
default the characters it tries to split on are ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
In addition to controlling which characters you can split on, you can also control a few other things:
length_function: how the length of chunks is calculated. Defaults to just counting number of characters, but it's pretty common
to pass a token counter here.
chunk_size: the maximum size of your chunks (as measured by the length function).
chunk_overlap: the maximum overlap between chunks. It can be nice to have some overlap to maintain some continuity
between chunks (eg do a sliding window).
add_start_index: whether to include the starting position of each chunk within the original document in the metadata.
# This is a long document we can split up.

    state_of_the_union = f.read()

\section{Introduction}
Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model that can be trained on vast amounts of text 
data to generate human-like language. In recent years, LLMs have made significant advances in a variety of 
natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.
\subsection{History of LLMs}
The earliest LLMs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were limited by the amount of data that 
could be processed and the computational power available at the time. In the past decade, however, advances 
in hardware and software have made it possible to train LLMs on massive datasets, leading to significant 
improvements in performance.

Mark downHeaderT extSplitt er
Motiv ation
Many chat or Q+A applications involve chunking input documents prior to embedding and vector storage.
These notes  from Pinecone provide some useful tips:
As mentioned, chunking often aims to keep text with common context together.
With this in mind, we might want to specifically honor the structure of the document itself.
For example, a markdown file is organized by headers.
Creating chunks within specific header groups is an intuitive idea.
To address this challenge, we can use MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter.
This will split a markdown file by a specified set of headers.
For example, if we want to split this markdown:
When a full paragraph or document is embedded, the embedding process considers both the overall context and 
the relationships between the sentences and phrases within the text. This can result in a more comprehensive 
vector representation that captures the broader meaning and themes of the text.

Recursively split by charact er
This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order
until the chunks are small enough. The default list is ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs
(and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically
related pieces of text.

Language models have a token limit. Y ou should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a
good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same
tokenizer as used in the language model.
tiktoken
tiktoken  is a fast BPE tokenizer created by OpenAI.
We can use it to estimate tokens used. It will probably be more accurate for the OpenAI models.

2. How the chunk size is measured: by tiktoken tokenizer

Text embedding models
The Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are lots of embedding model providers
(OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging F ace, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.
Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector
space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.
The base Embeddings class in LangChain exposes two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The
former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that
some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query
itself).

Setup
To start we'll need to install the OpenAI Python package:
Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to
set it as an environment variable by running:

Vector st ores
One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors,
and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are 'most similar' to the embedded
query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.
Get star ted
This walkthrough showcases basic functionality related to V ectorS tores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector
to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the text
embedding model  interfaces before diving into this.
This walkthrough uses the FAISS vector database, which makes use of the F acebook AI Similarity Search (F AISS) library.
We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API K ey.

Supabase (P ostgres)
Supabase  is an open source Firebase alternative. Supabase is built on top of PostgreSQL, which offers strong SQL querying
capabilities and enables a simple interface with already-existing tools and frameworks.
PostgreSQL  also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing
extensibility and SQL compliance.
This notebook shows how to use Supabase and pgvector as your V ectorS tore.
To run this notebook, please ensure:
the pgvector extension is enabled
you have installed the supabase-py package
that you have created a match_documents function in your database
that you have a documents table in your public schema similar to the one below.
The following function determines cosine similarity, but you can adjust to your needs.
       -- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
       create extension vector;
       -- Create a table to store your documents

    I’ve worked on these issues a long time.

Retrievers
A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does
not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. V ector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but
there are other types of retrievers as well.

The public API of the BaseRetriever class in LangChain is as follows:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, List
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.callbacks.manager import Callbacks
class BaseRetriever(ABC):
    ...
    def get_relevant_documents(

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/ 2/8It's that simple! Y ou can call get_relevant_documents or the async get_relevant_documents methods to retrieve documents
relevant to a query, where "relevance" is defined by the specific retriever object you are calling.
Of course, we also help construct what we think useful R etrievers are. The main type of R etriever that we focus on is a V ectorstore
retriever. W e will focus on that for the rest of this guide.
In order to understand what a vectorstore retriever is, it's important to understand what a V ectorstore is. So let's look at that.
By default, LangChain uses Chroma  as the vectorstore to index and search embeddings. T o walk through this tutorial, we'll first need to
install chromadb.            List of relevant documents

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/ 3/8This example showcases question answering over documents. W e have chosen this as the example for getting started because it nicely
combines a lot of different elements (T ext splitters, embeddings, vectorstores) and then also shows how to use them in a chain.
Question answering over documents consists of four steps:
1. Create an index
2. Create a R etriever from that index
3. Create a question answering chain
4. Ask questions!
Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations. In this notebook we will primarily focus on (1). W e will start by
showing the one-liner for doing so, but then break down what is actually going on.
First, let's import some common classes we'll use no matter what.
Next in the generic setup, let's specify the document loader we want to use. Y ou can download the state_of_the_union.txt file
here

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/ 4/8To get started as quickly as possible, we can use the VectorstoreIndexCreator.
Now that the index is created, we can use it to ask questions of the data! Note that under the hood this is actually doing a few steps
as well, which we will cover later in this guide.from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])
    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
index.query(query)
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top 
litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators 
and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support

Okay, so what's actually going on? How is this index getting created?    {'question': 'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson',

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/ 6/8A lot of the magic is being hid in this VectorstoreIndexCreator. What is this doing?
There are three main steps going on after the documents are loaded:
1. Splitting documents into chunks
2. Creating embeddings for each document
3. Storing documents and embeddings in a vectorstore
Let's walk through this in code
Next, we will split the documents into chunks.
We will then select which embeddings we want to use.
We now create the vectorstore to use as the index.documents = loader.load()
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/ 7/8So that's creating the index. Then, we expose this index in a retriever interface.
Then, as before, we create a chain and use it to answer questions!
VectorstoreIndexCreator is just a wrapper around all this logic. It is configurable in the text splitter it uses, the embeddings it uses,
and the vectorstore it uses. For example, you can configure it as below:db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)
    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
retriever = db.as_retriever()
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
qa.run(query)
    " The President said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former 
top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school 
educators and police officers. He said she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support

MultiQuer yR etr iev er
Distance-based vector database retrieval embeds (represents) queries in high-dimensional space and finds similar embedded
documents based on "distance". But, retrieval may produce difference results with subtle changes in query wording or if the
embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these
problems, but can be tedious.
The MultiQueryRetriever automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different
perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all
queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the
MultiQueryRetriever might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of
results.

Cont extual compr ession
One challenge with retrieval is that usually you don't know the specific queries your document storage system will face when you
ingest data into the system. This means that the information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of
irrelevant text. P assing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.
Contextual compression is meant to fix this. The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning retrieved documents as-is, you can
compress them using the context of the given query, so that only the relevant information is returned. “Compressing” here refers to
both compressing the contents of an individual document and filtering out documents wholesale.
To use the Contextual Compression R etriever, you'll need:
a base R etriever
a Document Compressor
The Contextual Compression R etriever passes queries to the base R etriever, takes the initial documents and passes them through the
Document Compressor. The Document Compressor takes a list of Documents and shortens it by reducing the contents of Documents
or dropping Documents altogether.

Self-quer ying
A self-querying retriever is one that, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language
query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to it's
underlying V ectorS tore. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the
contents of stored documented, but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute
those filters.

Qdrant self -quer ying
Qdrant  (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store,
search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it
useful
In the notebook we'll demo the SelfQueryRetriever wrapped around a Qdrant vector store.
Creating a Qdrant v ectorstore
First we'll want to create a Qdrant V ectorS tore and seed it with some data. W e've created a small demo set of documents that contain
summaries of movies.
NOTE: The self-query retriever requires you to have lark installed ( pip install lark). We also need the qdrant-client package.
We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API K ey.

You can also run the Chroma Server in a Docker container separately, create a Client to connect to it, and then pass that to LangChain.
Chroma has the ability to handle multiple Collections of documents, but the LangChain interface expects one, so we need to specify
the collection name. The default collection name used by LangChain is "langchain".

Vector st ore-backed retriever
A vector store retriever is a retriever that uses a vector store to retrieve documents. It is a lightweight wrapper around the V ector S tore
class to make it conform to the R etriever interface. It uses the search methods implemented by a vector store, like similarity search and
MMR, to query the texts in the vector store.
Once you construct a V ector store, it's very easy to construct a retriever. Let's walk through an example.
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

OpenAI plugins  connect ChatGPT to third-party applications. These plugins enable ChatGPT to interact with APIs defined by
developers, enhancing ChatGPT's capabilities and allowing it to perform a wide range of actions.
Plugins can allow ChatGPT to do things like:
Retrieve real-time information; e.g., sports scores, stock prices, the latest news, etc.
Retrieve knowledge-base information; e.g., company docs, personal notes, etc.
Perform actions on behalf of the user; e.g., booking a flight, ordering food, etc.

Chains
Using an LLM in isolation is fine for simple applications, but more complex applications require chaining LLMs - either with each other
or with other components.
LangChain provides the Chain  interface for such "chained" applications. W e define a Chain very generically as a sequence of calls to
components, which can include other chains. The base interface is simple:
This idea of composing components together in a chain is simple but powerful. It drastically simplifies and makes more modular the
implementation of complex applications, which in turn makes it much easier to debug, maintain, and improve your applications.
For more specifics check out:
class Chain(BaseModel, ABC):
    """Base interface that all chains should implement."""
    memory: BaseMemory
    callbacks: Callbacks
    def __call__(
        self,
        inputs: Any,
        return_only_outputs: bool = False,
        callbacks: Callbacks = None,
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:

Why do w e need chains?
Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain
that takes user input, formats it with a PromptT emplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. W e can build more
complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.

Using LLMChain
The LLMChain is most basic building block chain. It takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the
response from an LLM.
To use the LLMChain, first create a prompt template.
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
prompt = PromptTemplate(

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/ 3/4We can now create a very simple chain that will take user input, format the prompt with it, and then send it to the LLM.
If there are multiple variables, you can input them all at once using a dictionary.    input_variables=["product"],
    template="What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?",
)
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

Differ ent call methods
All classes inherited from Chain offer a few ways of running chain logic. The most direct one is by using __call__:
By default, __call__ returns both the input and output key values. Y ou can configure it to only return output key values by setting
return_only_outputs to True.
If the Chain only outputs one output key (i.e. only has one element in its output_keys), you can use run method. Note that run
outputs a string instead of a dictionary.
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
prompt_template = "Tell me a {adjective} joke"
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template))
llm_chain(inputs={"adjective": "corny"})
    {'adjective': 'corny',
     'text': 'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'}
llm_chain("corny", return_only_outputs=True)

Tips: Y ou can easily integrate a Chain object as a Tool in your Agent via its run method. See an example here.# llm_chain only has one output key, so we can use run
llm_chain.output_keys
    ['text']
llm_chain.run({"adjective": "corny"})
    'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'
# These two are equivalent
llm_chain.run({"adjective": "corny"})
llm_chain.run("corny")
# These two are also equivalent

Alternatively, we can split them up and save them separately. This is often useful to make the saved components more modular. In
order to do this, we just need to specify llm_path instead of the llm component, and prompt_path instead of the prompt
component.

LLM
An LLMChain is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models. It is used widely throughout LangChain,
including in other chains and agents.
An LLMChain consists of a PromptT emplate and a language model (either an LLM or chat model). It formats the prompt template
using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM
output.

as token usages and finish reason.input_list = [

    Black body radiation is the term used to describe the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a “black 
body”—an object that absorbs all radiation incident upon it. A black body is an idealized physical body that 
absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It does not 
reflect, emit or transmit energy. This type of radiation is the result of the thermal motion of the body's 
atoms and molecules, and it is emitted at all wavelengths. The spectrum of radiation emitted is described by 
Planck's law and is known as the black body spectrum.

    Black body radiation is the emission of energy from an idealized physical body (known as a black body) 
that is in thermal equilibrium with its environment. It is emitted in a characteristic pattern of frequencies 
known as a black-body spectrum, which depends only on the temperature of the body. The study of black body 
radiation is an important part of astrophysics and atmospheric physics, as the thermal radiation emitted by 
stars and planets can often be approximated as black body radiation.

Sequential
The next step after calling a language model is make a series of calls to a language model. This is particularly useful when you want to
take the output from one call and use it as the input to another.
In this notebook we will walk through some examples for how to do this, using sequential chains. Sequential chains allow you to
connect multiple chains and compose them into pipelines that execute some specific scenario.. There are two types of sequential
chains:
SimpleSequentialChain: The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of
one step is the input to the next.
SequentialChain: A more general form of sequential chains, allowing for multiple inputs/outputs.

Of course, not all sequential chains will be as simple as passing a single string as an argument and getting a single string as output for
all steps in the chain. In this next example, we will experiment with more complex chains that involve multiple inputs, and where there
also multiple final outputs.
Of particular importance is how we name the input/output variable names. In the above example we didn't have to think about that
because we were just passing the output of one chain directly as input to the next, but here we do have worry about that because we

dreams of a better life for himself. He soon meets a beautiful young woman named Mary, who shares his dream. 
The two fall in love and decide to elope and start a new life together.\n\nOn their journey, they make their 
way to a beach at sunset, where they plan to exchange their vows of love. Unbeknownst to them, their plans 
are overheard by John's father, who has been tracking them. He follows them to the beach and, in a fit of 
rage, confronts them. \n\nA physical altercation ensues, and in the struggle, John's father accidentally 
stabs Mary in the chest with his sword. The two are left in shock and disbelief as Mary dies in John's arms, 
her last words being a declaration of her love for him.\n\nThe tragedy of the play comes to a head when John, 
broken and with no hope of a future, chooses to take his own life by jumping off the cliffs into the sea 
below. \n\nThe play is a powerful story of love, hope, and loss set against the backdrop of 19th century

     'review': "\n\nThe latest production from playwright X is a powerful and heartbreaking story of love and 
loss set against the backdrop of 19th century England. The play follows John, a young man from a wealthy 
Victorian family, and Mary, a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. The two decide to elope and 
start a new life together, and the audience is taken on a journey of hope and optimism for the 
future.\n\nUnfortunately, their dreams are cut short when John's father discovers them and in a fit of rage, 
fatally stabs Mary. The tragedy of the play is further compounded when John, broken and without hope, takes 
his own life. The storyline is not only realistic, but also emotionally compelling, drawing the audience in 
from start to finish.\n\nThe acting was also commendable, with the actors delivering believable and nuanced 
performances. The playwright and director have successfully crafted a timeless tale of love and loss that 
will resonate with audiences for years to come. Highly recommended."}

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/sequential_chains 7/8Sometimes you may want to pass along some context to use in each step of the chain or in a later part of the chain, but maintaining
and chaining together the input/output variables can quickly get messy. Using SimpleMemory is a convenient way to do manage this
and clean up your chains.
For example, using the previous playwright SequentialChain, lets say you wanted to include some context about date, time and
location of the play, and using the generated synopsis and review, create some social media post text. Y ou could add these new
context variables as input_variables, or we can add a SimpleMemory to the chain to manage this context:
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain

llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a social media manager for a theater company.  Given the title of play, the era it is 
set in, the date,time and location, the synopsis of the play, and the review of the play, it is your job to 
write a social media post for that play.
Here is some context about the time and location of the play:

S tuff
The stuff documents chain ("stuff" as in "to stuff" or "to fill") is the most straightforward of the document chains. It takes a list of
documents, inserts them all into a prompt and passes that prompt to an LLM.
This chain is well-suited for applications where documents are small and only a few are passed in for most calls.

R efine
The refine documents chain constructs a response by looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer. For each
document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new
answer.
Since the R efine chain only passes a single document to the LLM at a time, it is well-suited for tasks that require analyzing more
documents than can fit in the model's context. The obvious tradeoff is that this chain will make far more LLM calls than, for example,
the S tuff documents chain. There are also certain tasks which are difficult to accomplish iteratively. For example, the R efine chain can
perform poorly when documents frequently cross-reference one another or when a task requires detailed information from many
documents.

Map r educe
The map reduce documents chain first applies an LLM chain to each document individually (the Map step), treating the chain output
as a new document. It then passes all the new documents to a separate combine documents chain to get a single output (the R educe
step). It can optionally first compress, or collapse, the mapped documents to make sure that they fit in the combine documents chain
(which will often pass them to an LLM). This compression step is performed recursively if necessary.

You can easily specify different chain types to load and use in the R etrievalQ A chain. For a more detailed walkthrough of these types,
please see this notebook .
There are two ways to load different chain types. First, you can specify the chain type argument in the from_chain_type method. This
allows you to pass in the name of the chain type you want to use. For example, in the below we change the chain type to map_reduce.    " The president said that she is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private 
practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. 
He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support, from the Fraternal 
Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."

chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in this notebook ) and then pass that
directly to the the R etrievalQ A chain with the combine_documents_chain parameter. For example:

Conv ersational R etrieval QA
The ConversationalR etrievalQ A chain builds on R etrievalQ AChain to provide a chat history component.
It first combines the chat history (either explicitly passed in or retrieved from the provided memory) and the question into a
standalone question, then looks up relevant documents from the retriever, and finally passes those documents and the question to a
question answering chain to return a response.
To create one, you will need a retriever. In the below example, we will create one from a vector store, which can be created from
embeddings.
Load in documents. Y ou can replace this with a loader for whatever type of data you want
If you had multiple loaders that you wanted to combine, you do something like:
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

This chain has two steps. First, it condenses the current question and the chat history into a standalone question. This is neccessary to
create a standanlone vector to use for retrieval. After that, it does retrieval and then answers the question using retrieval augmented
generation with a separate model. P art of the power of the declarative nature of LangChain is that you can easily use a separate
language model for each call. This can be useful to use a cheaper and faster model for the simpler task of condensing the question,
and then a more expensive model for answering the question. Here is an example of doing so.    ' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court.'

Using OpenAI functions
This walkthrough demonstrates how to incorporate OpenAI function-calling API's in a chain. W e'll go over:
1. How to use functions to get structured outputs from ChatOpenAI
2. How to create a generic chain that uses (multiple) functions
3. How to create a chain that actually executes the chosen function
Getting str uctur ed outputs # 
We can take advantage of OpenAI functions to try and force the model to return a particular kind of structured output. W e'll use the
create_structured_output_chain to create our chain, which takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as
JsonSchema.
See here for relevant reference docs .

To create a generic OpenAI functions chain, we can use the create_openai_fn_chain method. This is the same as
create_structured_output_chain except that instead of taking a single output schema, it takes a sequence of function definitions.
Functions can be passed in as:
dicts conforming to OpenAI functions spec,
Pydantic classes, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function they represent and descriptions for each of
the parameters,
Python functions, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function and args, along with type hints.

There are a number of more specific chains that use OpenAI functions.
Extraction : very similar to structured output chain, intended for information/entity extraction specifically.
Tagging : tag inputs.
OpenAPI : take an OpenAPI spec and create + execute valid requests against the API, using OpenAI functions under the hood.
QA with citations : use OpenAI functions ability to extract citations from text.    {'name': 'record_dog',

SQL
This example demonstrates the use of the SQLDatabaseChain for answering questions over a SQL database.
Under the hood, LangChain uses SQL Alchemy to connect to SQL databases. The SQLDatabaseChain can therefore be used with any
SQL dialect supported by SQL Alchemy, such as MS SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, P ostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks  and SQLite. Please refer
to the SQL Alchemy documentation for more information about requirements for connecting to your database. For example, a
connection to MySQL requires an appropriate connector such as PyMySQL. A URI for a MySQL connection might look like:
mysql+pymysql://user:pass@some_mysql_db_address/db_name.
This demonstration uses SQLite and the example Chinook database. T o set it up, follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-
sample-databases-sqlite/ , placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.
NOTE: For data-sensitive projects, you can specify return_direct=True in the SQLDatabaseChain initialization to directly return the
output of the SQL query without any additional formatting. This prevents the LLM from seeing any contents within the database. Note,
however, the LLM still has access to the database scheme (i.e. dialect, table and key names) by default.
from langchain import OpenAI, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain

Sometimes, the format of the data is not obvious and it is optimal to include a sample of rows from the tables in the prompt to allow
the LLM to understand the data before providing a final query. Here we will use this feature to let the LLM know that artists are saved
with their full names by providing two rows from the Track table.
The sample rows are added to the prompt after each corresponding table's column information:    'Examples of tracks by Johann Sebastian Bach are Concerto for 2 Violins in D Minor, BWV 1043: I. Vivace,

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/sqlite 11/34Custom T able Info
In some cases, it can be useful to provide custom table information instead of using the automatically generated table definitions and
the first sample_rows_in_table_info sample rows. For example, if you know that the first few rows of a table are uninformative, it
could help to manually provide example rows that are more diverse or provide more information to the model. It is also possible to
limit the columns that will be visible to the model if there are unnecessary columns.
This information can be provided as a dictionary with table names as the keys and table information as the values. For example, let's
provide a custom definition and sample rows for the T rack table with only a few columns:    SQLResult: [('American Woman', 'B. Cummings/G. Peterson/M.J. Kale/R. Bachman'), ('Concerto for 2 Violins

Summar ization
A summarization chain can be used to summarize multiple documents. One way is to input multiple smaller documents, after they
have been divided into chunks, and operate over them with a MapR educeDocumentsChain. Y ou can also choose instead for the chain
that does summarization to be a S tuffDocumentsChain, or a R efineDocumentsChain.
Prepare Data
First we prepare the data. For this example we create multiple documents from one long one, but these documents could be fetched
in any manner (the point of this notebook to highlight what to do AFTER you fetch the documents).

Self-critique chain with constitutional AI
The ConstitutionalChain is a chain that ensures the output of a language model adheres to a predefined set of constitutional
principles. By incorporating specific rules and guidelines, the ConstitutionalChain filters and modifies the generated content to align
with these principles, thus providing more controlled, ethical, and contextually appropriate responses. This mechanism helps maintain
the integrity of the output while minimizing the risk of generating content that may violate guidelines, be offensive, or deviate from
the desired context.

Extraction
The extraction chain uses the OpenAI functions parameter to specify a schema to extract entities from a document. This helps us
make sure that the model outputs exactly the schema of entities and properties that we want, with their appropriate types.
The extraction chain is to be used when we want to extract several entities with their properties from the same passage (i.e. what
people were mentioned in this passage?)

We can also use a Pydantic schema to choose the required properties and types and we will set as 'Optional' those that are not strictly
required.
By using the create_extraction_chain_pydantic function, we can send a Pydantic schema as input and the output will be an
instantiated object that respects our desired schema.
In this way, we can specify our schema in the same manner that we would a new class or function in Python - with purely Pythonic

This notebook is an implementation of Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FL ARE).
Please see the original repo here.
The basic idea is:
Start answering a question
If you start generating tokens the model is uncertain about, look up relevant documents
Use those documents to continue generating
Repeat until finished
There is a lot of cool detail in how the lookup of relevant documents is done. Basically, the tokens that model is uncertain about are
highlighted, and then an LLM is called to generate a question that would lead to that answer. For example, if the generated text is 
 Joe
Biden went to Harvard, and the tokens the model was uncertain about was Harvard, then a good generated question would be
where did Joe Biden go to college. This generated question is then used in a retrieval step to fetch relevant documents.
In order to set up this chain, we will need three things:
An LLM to generate the answer
An LLM to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval
A retriever to use to look up answers for

7/10/23, 10:30 AM FLARE | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/additional/flare 2/18The LLM that we use to generate the answer needs to return logprobs so we can identify uncertain tokens. For that reason, we HIGHL Y
recommend that you use the OpenAI wrapper (NB: not the ChatOpenAI wrapper, as that does not return logprobs).
The LLM we use to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval can be anything. In this notebook we will use ChatOpenAI
because it is fast and cheap.
The retriever can be anything. In this notebook we will use SERPER  search engine, because it is cheap.
Other important parameters to understand:
max_generation_len: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping to check if any are uncertain
min_prob: Any tokens generated with probability below this will be considered uncertain

    '\n\nThe Langchain framework and Baby AGI are both artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks that are used 
to create intelligent agents. The Langchain framework is a supervised learning system that is based on the 
concept of “language chains”. It uses a set of rules to map natural language inputs to specific outputs. It 
is a general-purpose AI framework and can be used to build applications such as natural language processing 
(NLP), chatbots, and more.\n\nBaby AGI, on the other hand, is an unsupervised learning system that uses 
neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn from its environment. It is used to create intelligent 
agents that can adapt to changing environments. It is a more advanced AI system and can be used to build more 
complex applications such as game playing, robotic vision, and more.\n\nThe main difference between the two 
is that the Langchain framework uses supervised learning while Baby AGI uses unsupervised learning. The 
Langchain framework is a general-purpose AI framework that can be used for various applications, while Baby 
AGI is a more advanced AI system that can be used to create more complex applications.'

can also run the database locally using the Neo4j Desktop application , or running a docker container. Y ou can run a local docker
container by running the executing the following script:
If you are using the docker container, you need to wait a couple of second for the database to start.

This notebook shows some examples of LLMSummarizationCheckerChain in use with different types of texts. It has a few distinct
differences from the LLMCheckerChain, in that it doesn't have any assumptions to the format of the input text (or summary).
Additionally, as the LLMs like to hallucinate when fact checking or get confused by context, it is sometimes beneficial to run the
checker multiple times. It does this by feeding the rewritten "T rue" result back on itself, and checking the "facts" for truth. As you can
see from the examples below, this can be very effective in arriving at a generally true body of text.
You can control the number of times the checker runs by setting the max_checks parameter. The default is 2, but you can set it to 1 if
you don't want any double-checking.

Moderation
This notebook walks through examples of how to use a moderation chain, and several common ways for doing so. Moderation chains
are useful for detecting text that could be hateful, violent, etc. This can be useful to apply on both user input, but also on the output of
a Language Model. Some API providers, like OpenAI, specifically prohibit  you, or your end users, from generating some types of
harmful content. T o comply with this (and to just generally prevent your application from being harmful) you may often want to
append a moderation chain to any LLMChains, in order to make sure any output the LLM generates is not harmful.
If the content passed into the moderation chain is harmful, there is not one best way to handle it, it probably depends on your
application. Sometimes you may want to throw an error in the Chain (and have your application handle that). Other times, you may
want to return something to the user explaining that the text was harmful. There could even be other ways to handle it! W e will cover
all these ways in this walkthrough.
We'll show:
1. How to run any piece of text through a moderation chain.
2. How to append a Moderation chain to an LLMChain.
How t o use the moderation chain

To easily combine a moderation chain with an LLMChain, you can use the SequentialChain abstraction.
Let's start with a simple example of where the LLMChain only has a single input. For this purpose, we will prompt the model so it says
something harmful.    'This is okay'

    ?
    
    The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. To 
solve this problem, we can break down the question into two parts: finding the first prime number greater 
than 40, and then finding a number that is divisible by 3. 
    
    The first step is to find the first prime number greater than 40. A prime number is a number that is only 
divisible by 1 and itself. The next prime number after 40 is 41.
    
    The second step is to find a number that is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add 1 to 41, which gives 
us 42. Now, we can check if 42 is divisible by 3. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 42 is divisible by 3.
    
    Therefore, the answer to the question is 43.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/additional/openapi 2/17Select the Operation
In order to provide a focused on modular chain, we create a chain specifically only for one of the endpoints. Here we get an API
operation from a specified endpoint and method.
Constr uct the chain
We can now construct a chain to interact with it. In order to construct such a chain, we will pass in:
1. The operation endpoint
2. A requests wrapper (can be used to handle authentication, etc)
3. The LLM to use to interact with it# Alternative loading from file
# spec = OpenAPISpec.from_file("openai_openapi.yaml")
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, "/public/openai/v0/products", "get")

OpenAPI calls with OpenAI functions
In this notebook we'll show how to create a chain that automatically makes calls to an API based only on an OpenAPI spec. Under the
hood, we're parsing the OpenAPI spec into a JSON schema that the OpenAI functions API can handle. This allows ChatGPT to
automatically select and populate the relevant API call to make for any user input. Using the output of ChatGPT we then make the
actual API call, and return the result.

Here we walk through how to use LangChain for question answering over a list of documents. Under the hood we'll be using our
Document chains .
Prepare Data
First we prepare the data. For this example we do similarity search over a vector database, but these documents could be fetched in
any manner (the point of this notebook to highlight what to do AFTER you fetch the documents).

The tagging chain uses the OpenAI functions parameter to specify a schema to tag a document with. This helps us make sure that
the model outputs exactly tags that we want, with their appropriate types.
The tagging chain is to be used when we want to tag a passage with a specific attribute (i.e. what is the sentiment of this message?)
Simplest appr oach, only specif ying type
We can start by specifying a few properties with their expected type in our schema

possible values for each property
description to make sure that the model understands the property
required properties to be returned

We can also use a Pydantic schema to specify the required properties and types. W e can also send other arguments, such as 'enum' or
'description' as can be seen in the example below.
By using the create_tagging_chain_pydantic function, we can send a Pydantic schema as input and the output will be an
instantiated object that respects our desired schema.
In this way, we can specify our schema in the same manner that we would a new class or function in Python - with purely Pythonic
types.    {'sentiment': 'neutral', 'aggressiveness': 0, 'language': 'english'}

This notebook walks through how to use LangChain for text generation over a vector index. This is useful if we want to generate text
that is able to draw from a large body of custom text, for example, generating blog posts that have an understanding of previous blog
posts written, or product tutorials that can refer to product documentation.
Prepare Data
First, we prepare the data. For this example, we fetch a documentation site that consists of markdown files hosted on Github and split
them into small enough Documents.

Now that we have the documentation content in chunks, let's put all this information in a vector index for easy retrieval.
Set Up LLM Chain with Cust om Pr ompt
Next, let's set up a simple LLM chain but give it a custom prompt for blog post generation. Note that the custom prompt is
parameterized and takes two inputs: context, which will be the documents fetched from the vector search, and topic, which is given
by the user.search_index = Chroma.from_documents(source_chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings())
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

Finally, we write a function to apply our inputs to the chain. The function takes an input parameter topic. We find the documents in
the vector index that correspond to that topic, and use them as additional context in our simple LLM chain.
def generate_blog_post(topic):
    docs = search_index.similarity_search(topic, k=4)

setter methods, so you can easily set and retrieve environment variables. For example, you can set the 
`FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` environment variables like 
this:\n\n```ts\nDeno.env.set("FIREBASE_API_KEY", "examplekey123");\nDeno.env.set("FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN", 
"firebasedomain.com");\n\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get("FIREBASE_API_KEY")); // 
examplekey123\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get("FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN")); // firebasedomain.com\n```\n\nYou can also 
store environment variables in a `.env` file. This is a great'}, {'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are a 
powerful tool for managing configuration settings in a program. They allow us to set values that can be used 
by the program, without having to hard-code them into the code. This makes it easier to change settings 
without having to modify the code.\n\nIn Deno, environment variables can be set in a few different ways. The 
most common way is to use the `VAR=value` syntax. This will set the environment variable `VAR` to the value 
`value`. This can be used to set any number of environment variables before running a command. For example, 
if we wanted to set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running a Deno command, we could do so 
like this:\n\n```\nVAR=hello deno run main.ts\n```\n\nThis will set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello`

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/additional/vector_db_text_generation 5/5before running the command. We can then access this variable in our code using the `Deno.env.get()` function. 
For example, if we ran the following command:\n\n```\nVAR=hello && deno eval "console.log(\'Deno: \' + 
Deno.env.get(\'VAR'}, {'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for developers, allowing them 
to store and access data without having to hard-code it into their applications. In Deno, you can access 
environment variables using the `Deno.env.get()` function.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to access the `HOME` 
environment variable, you could do so like this:\n\n```js\n// env.js\nDeno.env.get("HOME");\n```\n\nWhen 
running this code, you\'ll need to grant the Deno process access to environment variables. This can be done 
by passing the `--allow-env` flag to the `deno run` command. You can also specify which environment variables 
you want to grant access to, like this:\n\n```shell\n# Allow access to only the HOME env var\ndeno run --
allow-env=HOME env.js\n```\n\nIt\'s important to note that environment variables are case insensitive on 
Windows, so Deno also matches them case insensitively (on Windows only).\n\nAnother thing to be aware of when 
using environment variables is subprocess permissions. Subprocesses are powerful and can access system 
resources regardless of the permissions you granted to the Den'}, {'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are an 
important part of any programming language, and Deno is no exception. Deno is a secure JavaScript and 
TypeScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine, and it recently added support for environment 
variables. This feature was added in Deno version 1.6.0, and it is now available for use in Deno 
applications.\n\nEnvironment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs. They are 
typically used to store configuration information, such as the location of a database or the name of a user. 
In Deno, environment variables are stored in the `Deno.env` object. This object is similar to the 
`process.env` object in Node.js, and it allows you to access and set environment variables.\n\nThe `Deno.env` 
object is a read-only object, meaning that you cannot directly modify the environment variables. Instead, you 
must use the `Deno.env.set()` function to set environment variables. This function takes two arguments: the 
name of the environment variable and the value to set it to. For example, if you wanted to set the `FOO` 
environment variable to `bar`, you would use the following code:\n\n```'}]

Memor y
🚧 Docs under c onstr uction  🚧
By default, Chains and Agents are stateless, meaning that they treat each incoming query independently (like the underlying LLMs and
chat models themselves). In some applications, like chatbots, it is essential to remember previous interactions, both in the short and
long-term. The Memor y class does exactly that.
LangChain provides memory components in two forms. First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating
previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used. Secondly, LangChain provides
easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.
Get star ted
Memory involves keeping a concept of state around throughout a user's interactions with an language model. A user's interactions
with a language model are captured in the concept of ChatMessages, so this boils down to ingesting, capturing, transforming and
extracting knowledge from a sequence of chat messages. There are many different ways to do this, each of which exists as its own
memory type.
In general, for each type of memory there are two ways to understanding using memory. These are the standalone functions which
extract information from a sequence of messages, and then there is the way you can use this type of memory in a chain.
Memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous
messages). The returned information can either be a string or a list of messages.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/ 2/8We will walk through the simplest form of memory: "buffer" memory, which just involves keeping a buffer of all prior messages. W e
will show how to use the modular utility functions here, then show how it can be used in a chain (both returning a string as well as a
list of messages).
ChatMessageHist ory
One of the core utility classes underpinning most (if not all) memory modules is the ChatMessageHistory class. This is a super
lightweight wrapper which exposes convenience methods for saving Human messages, AI messages, and then fetching them all.
You may want to use this class directly if you are managing memory outside of a chain.

Adding Message Memor y backed by a
datab ase t o an Agent
This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent where the memory uses an external message store. Before going through this
notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:
Adding memory to an LLM Chain
Custom Agents
Agent with Memory
In order to add a memory with an external message store to an agent we are going to do the following steps:
1. We are going to create a RedisChatMessageHistory to connect to an external database to store the messages in.
2. We are going to create an LLMChain using that chat history as memory.
3. We are going to use that LLMChain to create a custom Agent.
For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the
ConversationBufferMemory class.

This notebook walks through a few ways to customize conversational memory.

The first way to do so is by changing the AI prefix in the conversation summary. By default, this is set to "AI", but you can set this to be
anything you want. Note that if you change this, you should also change the prompt used in the chain to reflect this naming change.
Let's walk through an example of that in the example below.

How t o create a cust om Memor y class
Although there are a few predefined types of memory in LangChain, it is highly possible you will want to add your own type of
memory that is optimal for your application. This notebook covers how to do that.
For this notebook, we will add a custom memory type to ConversationChain. In order to add a custom memory class, we need to
import the base memory class and subclass it.
In this example, we will write a custom memory class that uses spacy to extract entities and save information about them in a simple
hash table. Then, during the conversation, we will look at the input text, extract any entities, and put any information about them into
the context.
Please note that this implementation is pretty simple and brittle and probably not useful in a production setting. Its purpose is to
showcase that you can add custom memory implementations.
For this, we will need spacy.
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain
from langchain.schema import BaseMemory

from typing import List, Dict, Any
# !pip install spacy
# !python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

Conv ersation summar y memor y
Now let's take a look at using a slightly more complex type of memory - ConversationSummaryMemory. This type of memory creates a
summary of the conversation over time. This can be useful for condensing information from the conversation over time. Conversation
summary memory summarizes the conversation as it happens and stores the current summary in memory. This memory can then be
used to inject the summary of the conversation so far into a prompt/chain. This memory is most useful for longer conversations,
where keeping the past message history in the prompt verbatim would take up too many tokens.
Let's first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory.
We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory, ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})

ConversationSummaryBufferMemory combines the last two ideas. It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than
just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both. Unlike the previous implementation though,
it uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.
Let's first walk through how to use the utilities

Agents
Some applications require a flexible chain of calls to LLMs and other tools based on user input. The Agent  interface provides the
flexibility for such applications. An agent has access to a suite of tools, and determines which ones to use depending on the user
input. Agents can use multiple tools, and use the output of one tool as the input to the next.
There are two main types of agents:
Action agents : at each timestep, decide on the next action using the outputs of all previous actions
Plan-and-ex ecute agents : decide on the full sequence of actions up front, then execute them all without updating the plan
Action agents are suitable for small tasks, while plan-and-execute agents are better for complex or long-running tasks that require
maintaining long-term objectives and focus. Often the best approach is to combine the dynamism of an action agent with the
planning abilities of a plan-and-execute agent by letting the plan-and-execute agent use action agents to execute plans.
For a full list of agent types see agent types . Additional abstractions involved in agents are:
Tools: the actions an agent can take. What tools you give an agent highly depend on what you want the agent to do
Toolkits : wrappers around collections of tools that can be used together a specific use case. For example, in order for an agent to
interact with a SQL database it will likely need one tool to execute queries and another to inspect tables
Action agents
At a high-level an action agent:

----

7/10/23, 10:38 AM Agents | 🦜 🔗  Langchain
https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/ 2/41. Receives user input
2. Decides which tool, if any, to use and the tool input
3. Calls the tool and records the output (also known as an "observation")
4. Decides the next step using the history of tools, tool inputs, and observations
5. Repeats 3-4 until it determines it can respond directly to the user
Action agents are wrapped in agent ex ecutors, which are responsible for calling the agent, getting back an action and action input,
calling the tool that the action references with the generated input, getting the output of the tool, and then passing all that
information back into the agent to get the next action it should take.
Although an agent can be constructed in many ways, it typically involves these components:
Prompt t emplat e: Responsible for taking the user input and previous steps and constructing a prompt to send to the language
model
Language model : Takes the prompt with use input and action history and decides what to do next
Output p arser: Takes the output of the language model and parses it into the next action or a final answer
Plan-and-ex ecute agents
At a high-level a plan-and-execute agent:
1. Receives user input
2. Plans the full sequence of steps to take
3. Executes the steps in order, passing the outputs of past steps as inputs to future steps
The most typical implementation is to have the planner be a language model, and the executor be an action agent. R ead more here.

Agent types
Action agents
Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its
output, or returning a response to the user. Here are the agents available in LangChain.
Zero-shot R eAct
This agent uses the ReAct framework to determine which tool to use based solely on the tool's description. Any number of tools can
be provided. This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool.
Note: This is the most general purpose action agent.
Structur ed input R eAct
The structured tool chat agent is capable of using multi-input tools. Older agents are configured to specify an action input as a single
string, but this agent can use a tools' argument schema to create a structured action input. This is useful for more complex tool usage,
like precisely navigating around a browser.
OpenAI Functions
Certain OpenAI models (like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613) have been explicitly fine-tuned to detect when a function should to
be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function. The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with

Conv ersational
This agent is designed to be used in conversational settings. The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational. It
uses the R eAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions.
Self ask with sear ch
This agent utilizes a single tool that should be named Intermediate Answer. This tool should be able to lookup factual answers to
questions. This agent is equivalent to the original self ask with search paper , where a Google search API was provided as the tool.
ReAct document st ore
This agent uses the R eAct framework to interact with a docstore. T wo tools must be provided: a Search tool and a Lookup tool (they
must be named exactly as so). The Search tool should search for a document, while the Lookup tool should lookup a term in the
most recently found document. This agent is equivalent to the original ReAct paper , specifically the Wikipedia example.
Plan-and-ex ecute agents
Plan and execute agents accomplish an objective by first planning what to do, then executing the sub tasks. This idea is largely
inspired by BabyA GI and then the "Plan-and-Solve" paper .

This walkthrough demonstrates how to use an agent optimized for conversation. Other agents are often optimized for using tools to
figure out the best response, which is not ideal in a conversational setting where you may want the agent to be able to chat with the
user as well.
This is accomplished with a specific type of agent ( conversational-react-description) which expects to be used with a memory
component.

Plan and ex ecute
Plan and execute agents accomplish an objective by first planning what to do, then executing the sub tasks. This idea is largely
inspired by BabyA GI and then the "Plan-and-Solve" paper .
The planning is almost always done by an LLM.
The execution is usually done by a separate agent (equipped with tools).

Combine agents and v ector st ores
This notebook covers how to combine agents and vectorstores. The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a
vectorstore and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.
The recommended method for doing so is to create a R etrievalQ A and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at
doing this below. Y ou can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two
different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vectorstores as normal tools, or you can set return_direct=True to
really just use the agent as a router.
Create the V ectorstore

Async API
LangChain provides async support for Agents by leveraging the asyncio  library.
Async methods are currently supported for the following Tools: GoogleSerperAPIWrapper, SerpAPIWrapper and LLMMathChain.
Async support for other agent tools are on the roadmap.
For Tools that have a coroutine implemented (the three mentioned above), the AgentExecutor will await them directly.
Otherwise, the AgentExecutor will call the Tool's func via asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor to avoid blocking the
main runloop.
You can use arun to call an AgentExecutor asynchronously.
Serial vs. Concurr ent Ex ecution # 
In this example, we kick off agents to answer some questions serially vs. concurrently. Y ou can see that concurrent execution
significantly speeds this up.

Custom agent with t ool r etrieval
This notebook builds off of this notebook  and assumes familiarity with how agents work.
The novel idea introduced in this notebook is the idea of using retrieval to select the set of tools to use to answer an agent query. This
is useful when you have many many tools to select from. Y ou cannot put the description of all the tools in the prompt (because of
context length issues) so instead you dynamically select the N tools you do want to consider using at run time.
In this notebook we will create a somewhat contrieved example. W e will have one legitimate tool (search) and then 99 fake tools which
are just nonsense. W e will then add a step in the prompt template that takes the user input and retrieves tool relevant to the query.
Set up envir onment #

Custom LLM Agent
This notebook goes through how to create your own custom LLM agent.
An LLM agent consists of three parts:
PromptT emplate: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do
LLM: This is the language model that powers the agent
stop sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found
OutputP arser: This determines how to parse the LLMOutput into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object
The LLMAgent is used in an AgentExecutor. This AgentExecutor can largely be thought of as a loop that:
1. Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLMAgent)
2. If the Agent returns an AgentFinish, then return that directly to the user
3. If the Agent returns an AgentAction, then use that to call a tool and get an Observation
4. Repeat, passing the AgentAction and Observation back to the Agent until an AgentFinish is emitted.
AgentAction is a response that consists of action and action_input. action refers to which tool to use, and action_input refers
to the input to that tool. log can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc).
AgentFinish is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user. This should be used to end an agent run.
In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom LLM agent.

Custom LLM Agent (with a ChatModel)
This notebook goes through how to create your own custom agent based on a chat model.
An LLM chat agent consists of three parts:
PromptT emplate: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do
ChatModel: This is the language model that powers the agent
stop sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found
OutputP arser: This determines how to parse the LLMOutput into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object
The LLMAgent is used in an AgentExecutor. This AgentExecutor can largely be thought of as a loop that:
1. Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLMAgent)
2. If the Agent returns an AgentFinish, then return that directly to the user
3. If the Agent returns an AgentAction, then use that to call a tool and get an Observation
4. Repeat, passing the AgentAction and Observation back to the Agent until an AgentFinish is emitted.
AgentAction is a response that consists of action and action_input. action refers to which tool to use, and action_input refers
to the input to that tool. log can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc).
AgentFinish is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user. This should be used to end an agent run.
In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom LLM agent.

Custom MRKL agent
This notebook goes through how to create your own custom MRKL agent.
A MRKL agent consists of three parts:
In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom MRKL agent by creating a custom LLMChain.
Custom LLMChain
The first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom LLMChain. This is the simplest way to create
a custom Agent. It is highly recommended that you work with the ZeroShotAgent, as at the moment that is by far the most
generalizable one.
Most of the work in creating the custom LLMChain comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse
the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. Additionally, we currently require an
agent_scratchpad input variable to put notes on previous actions and observations. This should almost always be the final part of
the prompt. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish.
- Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.
- LLMChain: The LLMChain that produces the text that is parsed in a certain way to determine which action to 
take.
- The agent class itself: this parses the output of the LLMChain to determine which action to take.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_mrkl_agent 2/7To ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for
the ZeroShotAgent takes the following arguments:
tools: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt.
prefix: S tring to put before the list of tools.
suffix: S tring to put after the list of tools.
input_variables: List of input variables the final prompt will expect.
For this exercise, we will give our agent access to Google Search, and we will customize it in that we will have it answer as a pirate.

Custom multi-action agent
This notebook goes through how to create your own custom agent.
An agent consists of two parts:
In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom agent that predicts/takes multiple steps at a time.
- Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.
- The agent class itself: this decides which action to take.

Occasionally the LLM cannot determine what step to take because it outputs format in incorrect form to be handled by the output
parser. In this case, by default the agent errors. But you can easily control this functionality with handle_parsing_errors! Let's
explore how.

Cap the max number o f iterations
This notebook walks through how to cap an agent at taking a certain number of steps. This can be useful to ensure that they do not
go haywire and take too many steps.
First, let's do a run with a normal agent to show what would happen without this parameter. For this example, we will use a specifically
crafter adversarial example that tries to trick it into continuing forever.
Try running the cell below and see what happens!

This notebook goes over adding memory to both  of an Agent and its tools. Before going through this notebook, please walk through
the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:
Adding memory to an LLM Chain
Custom Agents
We are going to create a custom Agent. The agent has access to a conversation memory, search tool, and a summarization tool. And,
the summarization tool also needs access to the conversation memory.

Streaming final agent output
If you only want the final output of an agent to be streamed, you can use the callback FinalStreamingStdOutCallbackHandler. For
this, the underlying LLM has to support streaming as well.
Let's create the underlying LLM with streaming = True and pass a new instance of FinalStreamingStdOutCallbackHandler.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/streaming_stdout_final_only 2/3Handling cust om answ er pr efixes
By default, we assume that the token sequence "Final", "Answer", ":" indicates that the agent has reached an answers. W e can,
however, also pass a custom sequence to use as answer prefix.
For convenience, the callback automatically strips whitespaces and new line characters when comparing to answer_prefix_tokens.
I.e., if answer_prefix_tokens = ["The", " answer", ":"] then both ["\nThe", " answer", ":"] and 
["The", " answer",
":"] would be recognized a the answer prefix.
If you don't know the tokenized version of your answer prefix, you can determine it with the following code:    "It's 2023 now. How many years ago did Konrad Adenauer become Chancellor of Germany."
)
     Konrad Adenauer became Chancellor of Germany in 1949, 74 years ago in 2023.

When the parameter stream_prefix = True is set, the answer prefix itself will also be streamed. This can be useful when the answer
prefix itself is part of the answer. For example, when your answer is a JSON like

and you don't only want the action_input to be streamed, but the entire JSON.from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler

Tools
Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world.
Get star ted
Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world. These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or
even other agents.
Currently, tools can be loaded with the following snippet:
Some tools (e.g. chains, agents) may require a base LLM to use to initialize them. In that case, you can pass in an LLM as well:
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tool_names = [...]
tools = load_tools(tool_names)
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tool_names = [...]
llm = ...
tools = load_tools(tool_names, llm=llm)

Defining Cust om T ools
When constructing your own agent, you will need to provide it with a list of T ools that it can use. Besides the actual function that is
called, the T ool consists of several components:
name (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent
description (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use
return_direct (bool), defaults to F alse
args_schema (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot
examples) or validation for expected parameters.
There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below.
Initialize the LLM to use for the agent.
# Import things that are needed generically

The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output. If your tool function requires multiple arguments, you might
want to skip down to the StructuredTool section below.
There are two ways to do this: either by using the T ool dataclass, or by subclassing the BaseT ool class.
Tool dataclass
The 'T ool' dataclass wraps functions that accept a single string input and returns a string output.

execution, you can raise a ToolException and set handle_tool_error accordingly.
When ToolException is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the handle_tool_error
variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red.
You can set handle_tool_error to True, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it's set as a function, the function
should take a ToolException as a parameter and return a str value.
Please note that only raising a ToolException won't be effective. Y ou need to first set the handle_tool_error of the tool because its
default value is False.    'Answer: 1.086734862526058'

Human-in-the-loop T ool V alidation
This walkthrough demonstrates how to add Human validation to any T ool. W e'll do this using the HumanApprovalCallbackhandler.
Let's suppose we need to make use of the ShellT ool. Adding this tool to an automated flow poses obvious risks. Let's see how we
could enforce manual human approval of inputs going into this tool.
Note: We generally recommend against using the ShellT ool. There's a lot of ways to misuse it, and it's not required for most use cases.
We employ it here only for demonstration purposes.
from langchain.callbacks import HumanApprovalCallbackHandler
from langchain.tools import ShellTool
tool = ShellTool()
print(tool.run("echo Hello World!"))
    Hello World!

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/how_to/human_approval 2/12Adding Human Appr oval
Adding the default HumanApprovalCallbackHandler to the tool will make it so that a user has to manually approve every input to the
tool before the command is actually executed.
tool = ShellTool(callbacks=[HumanApprovalCallbackHandler()])
print(tool.run("ls /usr"))
    Do you approve of the following input? Anything except 'Y'/'Yes' (case-insensitive) will be treated as a 
no.

An alternative to the structured tool would be to use the regular Tool class and accept a single string. The tool would then have to
handle the parsing logic to extract the relavent values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent
prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can't reliabl generate structured schema.
Let's take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the "Action Input" as a
comma-separated list of length two. W e will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and
passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.
Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input.    }

and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first \nquarter, with Search 
performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored \nin deep computer 
science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see \nhuge 
opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and 
Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 \nconsolidated revenues of $69.8 
billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed \nto delivering long-term 
growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering \nour cost 
base.”\nQ1 2023  financial highlights  (unaudited)\nOur first quarter  2023 results reflect:\ni.$2.6 billion  
in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space; \nii.a $988 million  reduction in 
depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and \ncertain network equipment; 
and\niii.a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively 
less  \nstock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters 
of \nthe ye ar. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense 
over the \nfull fiscal year 2023.\nFor further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the

unique \nopportunity for Tesla. As many carmakers are working through challenges with the \nunit economics of 
their EV programs, we aim to leverage our position as a cost \nleader. We are focused on rapidly growing 
production, investments in autonomy \nand vehicle software, and remaining on track with our growth 
investments.\nOur near -term pricing strategy considers a long -term view on per vehicle \nprofitability 
given the potential lifetime value of a Tesla vehicle through autonomy, \nsupercharging, connectivity and 
service. We expect that our product pricing will \ncontinue to evolve, upwards or downwards, depending on a 
number of factors.\nAlthough we implemented price reductions on many vehicle models across regions \nin the 
first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable rate. We \nexpect ongoing cost reduction of our 
vehicles, including improved production \nefficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and 
remain focused on \noperating leverage as we scale.\nWe are rapidly growing energy storage production 
capacity at our Megafactory in \nLathrop and we recently announced a new Megafactory in Shanghai. We are also

(GWh)Energy Storage\nEnergy storage deployments increased by 360% YoY in Q1 to 3.9 GWh, the highest \nlevel 
of deployments we have achieved due to ongoing Megafactory ramp. The ramp of our 40 GWh Megapack factory in 
Lathrop, California has been successful with still more room to reach full capacity. This Megapack factory 
will be the first of many. We recently announced our second 40 GWh Megafactory, this time in Shanghai, with 
construction starting later this year. \nSolar\nSolar deployments increased by 40% YoY in Q1 to 67 MW, but 
declined sequentially in \nthe quarter, predominantly due to volatile weather and other factors. In addition, 
the solar industry has been impacted by supply chain challenges.\nServices and Other\nBoth revenue and gross 
profit from Services and Other reached an all -time high in Q1 \n2023. Within this business division, growth 
of used vehicle sales remained strong YoY and had healthy margins. Supercharging, while still a relatively 
small part of the business, continued to grow as we gradually open up the network to non- Tesla \nvehicles.

long -term view on per vehicle \nprofitability given the potential lifetime value of a Tesla vehicle through 
autonomy, \nsupercharging, connectivity and service. We expect that our product pricing will \ncontinue to 
evolve, upwards or downwards, depending on a number of factors.\nAlthough we implemented price reductions on 
many vehicle models across regions \nin the first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable 
rate. We \nexpect ongoing cost reduction of our vehicles, including improved production \nefficiency at our

SQL Datab ase Agent
This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a sql databases. The agent builds off of SQLDatabaseChain  and is
designed to answer more general questions about a database, as well as recover from errors.
Note that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that the agent
won't perform DML statements on your database given certain questions. Be careful running it on sensitive data!
This uses the example Chinook database. T o set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/ ,
placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.

This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with large JSON/dict objects. This is useful when you want to answer
questions about a JSON blob that's too large to fit in the context window of an LLM. The agent is able to iteratively explore the blob
to find what it needs to answer the user's question.
In the below example, we are using the OpenAPI spec for the OpenAI API, which you can find here.

Callb acks
LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for
logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks.
You can subscribe to these events by using the callbacks argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler
objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail.
Callb ack handler s
CallbackHandlers are objects that implement the CallbackHandler interface, which has a method for each event that can be
subscribed to. The CallbackManager will call the appropriate method on each handler when the event is triggered.

LangChain provides a few built-in handlers that you can use to get started. These are available in the langchain/callbacks module.
The most basic handler is the StdOutCallbackHandler, which simply logs all events to stdout.
Note when the verbose flag on the object is set to true, the StdOutCallbackHandler will be invoked even without being explicitly
passed in.    def on_tool_error(
        self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/callbacks/ 5/6Wher e to pass in callb acks
The callbacks argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, T ools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:
Constr uctor callb acks: defined in the constructor, eg. LLMChain(callbacks=[handler], tags=['a-tag']), which will be used
for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, eg. if you pass a handler to the LLMChain constructor, it
will not be used by the Model attached to that chain.
Request callb acks: defined in the call()/run()/apply() methods used for issuing a request, eg. 
 chain.call(inputs,
callbacks=[handler]), which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an
LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the call() method).
The verbose argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, T ools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor
argument, eg. LLMChain(verbose=True), and it is equivalent to passing a ConsoleCallbackHandler to the callbacks argument of
that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.
When do y ou want t o use each o f these?
Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are not speci fic to a single r equest , but
rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an LLMChain, you would pass a handler to the
constructor.
Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a
specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a    > Finished chain.

If you are planning to use the async API, it is recommended to use AsyncCallbackHandler to avoid blocking the runloop.
Advanced  if you use a sync CallbackHandler while using an async method to run your llm/chain/tool/agent, it will still work.
However, under the hood, it will be called with run_in_executor which can cause issues if your CallbackHandler is not thread-safe.

Callb acks for cust om chains
When you create a custom chain you can easily set it up to use the same callback system as all the built-in chains. _call, _generate,
_run, and equivalent async methods on Chains / LLMs / Chat Models / Agents / T ools now receive a 2nd argument called
run_manager which is bound to that run, and contains the logging methods that can be used by that object (i.e. on_llm_new_token).
This is useful when constructing a custom chain. See this guide for more information on how to create custom chains and use
callbacks inside them .

Multiple callb ack handler s
In the previous examples, we passed in callback handlers upon creation of an object by using callbacks=. In this case, the callbacks
will be scoped to that particular object.
However, in many cases, it is advantageous to pass in handlers instead when running the object. When we pass through
CallbackHandlers using the callbacks keyword arg when executing an run, those callbacks will be issued by all nested objects
involved in the execution. For example, when a handler is passed through to an Agent, it will be used for all callbacks related to the
agent and all the objects involved in the agent's execution, in this case, the Tools, LLMChain, and LLM.
This prevents us from having to manually attach the handlers to each individual nested object.

Token counting
LangChain offers a context manager that allows you to count tokens.
import asyncio
from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    llm("What is the square root of 4?")
total_tokens = cb.total_tokens
assert total_tokens > 0
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    llm("What is the square root of 4?")
    llm("What is the square root of 4?")
assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 2
# You can kick off concurrent runs from within the context manager
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    await asyncio.gather(
        *[llm.agenerate(["What is the square root of 4?"]) for _ in range(3)]
    )
